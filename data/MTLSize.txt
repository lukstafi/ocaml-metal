Structure
MTLSize
The dimensions of an object.
typedef struct MTLSize {
    ...
} MTLSize;
Overview
Metal has many object types that represent arrays of discrete elements. For example, a texture has an array of pixel elements, and a thread grid has an array of computational threads. Use MTLSize instances to measure the extents of these objects or extents of regions within these objects.
Conceptually, when using a MTLSize instance to measure an object, treat the object as a 3D array of elements, even if it has fewer dimensions. Set the length of any unused dimensions to 1. For example, a 5x5 2D texture is a 5x5x1 texture in 3D.
