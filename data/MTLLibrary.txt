Protocol
MTLLibrary
A collection of Metal shader functions.
@protocol MTLLibrary
Overview
A MTLLibrary object contains Metal shading language source code compiled during an app’s build process or at runtime from a text string.
Don’t implement this protocol yourself; instead, use the library creation methods provided by the MTLDevice protocol. To create a MTLLibrary from a precompiled Metal library binary, call one of these MTLDevice methods:
newDefaultLibrary
newLibraryWithFile:error:
newLibraryWithData:error:
To create a MTLLibrary by compiling source code at runtime, call one of these MTLDevice methods:
newLibraryWithSource:options:completionHandler:
newLibraryWithSource:options:error:
