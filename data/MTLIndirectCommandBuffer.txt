@protocol MTLIndirectCommandBuffer
Overview
Use an indirect command buffer to encode commands once and reuse them, and to encode commands on multiple CPU or GPU threads.
Donâ€™t implement this protocol yourself; instead, create a MTLIndirectCommandBufferDescriptor object, configure its properties, and tell the MTLDevice to create the indirect command buffer. See Creating an Indirect Command Buffer.
