Protocol
MTLCommandQueue
An instance you use to create, submit, and schedule command buffers to a specific GPU device to run the commands within those buffers.
@protocol MTLCommandQueue
Overview
A command queue maintains an ordered list of command buffers. You use a command queue to:
Create command buffers, which you fill with commands for the GPU device that creates the queue
Submit command buffers to run on that GPU
Create a command queue from an MTLDevice instance by calling its newCommandQueue or newCommandQueueWithMaxCommandBufferCount: method. Typically, you create one or more command queues when your app launches and then keep them throughout your app’s lifetime.
With each MTLCommandQueue instance you create, you can create MTLCommandBuffer instances for that queue by calling its commandBuffer or commandBufferWithUnretainedReferences method.
Note
Each command queue is thread-safe and allows you to encode commands in multiple command buffers simultaneously.
For more information about command buffers and encoding GPU commands to them — such as rendering images and computing data in parallel — see Setting Up a Command Structure.
Topics
Creating Command Buffers
- commandBufferWithDescriptor:
Returns a command buffer from the command queue that you configure with a descriptor.
Required
- commandBuffer
Returns a command buffer from the command queue that maintains strong references to resources.
Required
- commandBufferWithUnretainedReferences
Returns a command buffer from the command queue that doesn’t maintain strong references to resources.
Required
Attaching Residency Sets
- addResidencySet:
Attaches a residency set to the queue, which Metal attaches to its command buffers as you commit them.
Required
- addResidencySets:count:
Attaches multiple residency sets to the queue, which Metal attaches to its command buffers as you commit them.
Required
Detaching Residency Sets
- removeResidencySet:
Detaches a residency set from the command queue, which prevents Metal from attaching it to the queue’s command buffers as you commit them.
Required
- removeResidencySets:count:
Detaches multiple residency sets from the command queue, which prevents Metal from attaching them to the queue’s command buffers as you commit them.
