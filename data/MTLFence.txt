Protocol
MTLFence
A memory fence to capture, track, and manage resource dependencies across command encoders.
@protocol MTLFence
Overview
An MTLFence instance is typically used to track a resource created from an MTLHeap instance. You can also track non-heap resources that have tracking mode MTLResourceHazardTrackingModeUntracked.
To create an MTLFence instance, call the newFence method of an MTLDevice instance. A command encoder can either update a fence or wait for a fence.
Tip
When using a fence across multiple MTLCommandQueue instances, commit the queue that updates a fence before committing the queue that waits on a fence. Consider using an MTLEvent instead of a fence for these situations.
