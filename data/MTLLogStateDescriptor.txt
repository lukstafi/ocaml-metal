Class
MTLLogStateDescriptor
An interface that represents a log state configuration.
@interface MTLLogStateDescriptor : NSObject
Overview
Configure the descriptor to create an MTLLogState by calling newLogStateWithDescriptor:error:.
If you’ve set the environment variables MTL_LOG_BUFFER_SIZE or MTL_LOG_LEVEL, then the system automatically enables logging. If any command buffer or command queue has an attached log state, then the system uses the log state’s settings instead of the environment variable values.
