Protocol
MTLFunction
An object that represents a public shader function in a Metal library.
@protocol MTLFunction
Overview
Use MTLFunction objects to specify which shaders a Metal pipeline calls when the GPU executes commands that specify that pipeline. For more information on creating pipeline state objects, see MTLRenderPipelineDescriptor and MTLComputePipelineDescriptor.
A MTLFunction object is a specialized function if the shader contains function constants, otherwise it is a nonspecialized function.
Don’t use standard allocation and initialization techniques to create a MTLFunction object. Instead, use the function creation methods provided by the MTLLibrary protocol. To create a nonspecialized function, call the newFunctionWithName: method.
To create a specialized function, call one of these MTLLibrary methods:
newFunctionWithName:constantValues:completionHandler:
newFunctionWithName:constantValues:error:
MTLFunction objects can use a significant amount of memory; release any strong references to them after you finish creating pipeline objects.
