@protocol MTLResource
Overview
Important
Don’t implement this protocol yourself. Create resources by calling methods on MTLDevice, MTLBuffer, or MTLTexture.
When you execute commands on the GPU, those commands can only affect memory allocated as MTLResource objects. Only the MTLDevice that created these resources can modify them. Different resource types have different uses. The most common resource types are buffers (MTLBuffer), which are linear allocations of memory, and textures (MTLTexture), which hold structured image data.
Topics
Identifying the Resource
device
The device object that created the resource.
Required
label
A string that identifies the resource.
Required
Reading Memory and Storage Properties
cpuCacheMode
The CPU cache mode that defines the CPU mapping of the resource.
Required
storageMode
The location and access permissions of the resource.
Required
hazardTrackingMode
A mode that determines whether Metal tracks and synchronizes resource access.
Required
resourceOptions
The storage mode, CPU cache mode, and hazard tracking mode of the resource.
Required
MTLCPUCacheMode
Options for the CPU cache mode that define the CPU mapping of the resource.
MTLStorageMode
Options for the memory location and access permissions for a resource.
MTLHazardTrackingMode
The options you use to specify the hazard tracking mode.
Setting the Purgeable State of the Resource
- setPurgeableState:
Specifies or queries the resource’s purgeable state.
Required
MTLPurgeableState
The purgeable state of the resource.
Managing Heap Resources
heapOffset
The distance, in bytes, from the beginning of the heap to the first byte of the resource, if you allocated the resource on a heap.
Required
heap
The heap on which the resource is allocated, if any.
Required
- makeAliasable
Allows future heap resource allocations to alias against the resource’s memory, reusing it.
Required
- isAliasable
A Boolean value that indicates whether future heap resource allocations may alias against the resource’s memory.
Required
Querying the Allocated Size
allocatedSize
The size of the resource, in bytes.
Required
