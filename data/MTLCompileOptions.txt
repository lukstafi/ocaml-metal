Class
MTLCompileOptions
Compilation settings for a Metal shader library.
@interface MTLCompileOptions : NSObject
Overview
You can configure the Metal compiler’s options by setting any or all of an MTLCompileOptions instance’s properties, including the following:
Target previous OS releases by assigning the languageVersion property to an MTLLanguageVersion case.
Set preprocessor macros for the Metal compiler by assigning a dictionary to the preprocessorMacros property.
Choose what the Metal compiler’s optimizer prioritizes by setting the optimizationLevel property to an MTLLibraryOptimizationLevel case.
Allow the compiler to optimize for floating-point arithmetic that may violate the IEEE 754 standard by setting mathMode to MTLMathModeFast.
You can compile a library with your compile options instance by calling an MTLDevice instance’s newLibraryWithSource:options:error: or newLibraryWithSource:options:completionHandler: method.
Topics
Configuring the Compiler Options
enableLogging
A Boolean value that enables shader logging.
mathMode
An indication of whether the compiler can perform optimizations for floating-point arithmetic that may violate the IEEE 754 standard.
mathFloatingPointFunctions
The FP32 math functions Metal uses.
preserveInvariance
A Boolean value that indicates whether the compiler compiles vertex shaders conservatively to generate consistent position calculations.
languageVersion
The language version for interpreting the library source code.
preprocessorMacros
A list of preprocessor macros to apply when compiling the library source.
optimizationLevel
An option that tells the compiler what to prioritize when it compiles Metal shader code.
libraries
An array of dynamic libraries the Metal compiler links against.
fastMathEnabled
A Boolean value that indicates whether the compiler can perform optimizations for floating-point arithmetic that may violate the IEEE 754 standard.
Deprecated
