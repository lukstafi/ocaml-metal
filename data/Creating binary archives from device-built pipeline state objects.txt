Creating Binary Archives from Device-Built Pipeline State Objects
Write your Metal pipeline states to a binary archive at app runtime, and build binaries for any supported GPU.
Overview
When building your shaders at runtime, Metal uses pipeline state descriptors in addition to the Metal IR it compiles from your shader functions. To build binary archives for distribution, the compiler needs some information about your app’s Metal pipelines, and a way to interpret them. When serializing a binary archive to device storage from your app, Metal includes a pipeline configuration script with it. The Metal translator is the part of the compiler that reads these configurations, and enables GPU-specific compilation for platforms other than the host GPU. Invoke the translator with the metal-tt command in Terminal or from a build script.
A block flow diagram of the workflow for creating Metal binary archives. At the upper left, the process starts with a shader.msl source file that flows to the metal command-line tool and the resulting Metal IR library, shader.metallib. At the bottom middle, an independent workflow shows two boxes labeled Extract from app and Author with text editor. These combine to a final configuration script named HASH.mtlp-json. At the right, the Metal IR library and Metal config boxes flow together into the metal-tt command-line tool and produce the final product of a binary archive named shader.binary.metallib.
This article explains how to serialize an MTLBinaryArchive instance, extract the binary archive from an app you deploy to a device in Xcode, and provide it to the Metal translator to create GPU binaries for your project. You can use the code examples in this article with the app and shaders from the Using a Render Pipeline to Render Primitives sample. Another common approach is to create a small command-line tool that loads and compiles your shaders to an initial binary archive in macOS, which you can integrate as part your app’s build scripts.
Note
MTLBinaryArchive serialization on device doesn’t have support for specialized functions. For shaders using specialized functions, you need to manually edit the configuration script. For instructions, see Compiling Binary Archives from a Custom Configuration Script.
Create a Metal Binary Archive in Your App
Create an instance of MTLBinaryArchive from an MTLBinaryArchiveDescriptor with a nil url property. This instructs Metal to create, rather than load, a binary archive. After creating the archive, add all pipeline descriptors you use in your encoder to the binary archive. The following code example performs these steps for an MTLDevice instance named device and an MTLRenderPipelineDescriptor instance named pipelineStateDescriptor:
MTLBinaryArchiveDescriptor *archiveDescriptor = [[MTLBinaryArchiveDescriptor alloc] init];
id<MTLBinaryArchive> archive = [_device newBinaryArchiveWithDescriptor:archiveDescriptor error:&error];
NSAssert(archive, @"Failed to create binary archive: %@", error);


BOOL success = [archive addRenderPipelineFunctionsWithDescriptor:pipelineStateDescriptor error:&error];
Tip
If you’re adding binary archive serialization to an existing app, create your render pipeline state after creating your binary archive instance in the app. When you do, Metal can take advantage of optimizations that increase shader compilation speed and reduce memory usage.
After adding pipeline descriptors to the binary archive, serialize it to storage. The following code example shows how to serialize an MTLBinaryArchive instance to device storage:
-(BOOL) serializeBinaryArchive:(id<MTLBinaryArchive>)archive named:(NSString*)name error:(NSError**)error {
    BOOL success = false;


    NSURL* directory = [[NSFileManager defaultManager] URLForDirectory:NSApplicationSupportDirectory inDomain:NSUserDomainMask appropriateForURL:nil create:YES error:error];
#if TARGET_OS_OSX
    directory = [[NSURL URLWithString:[[NSBundle mainBundle] bundleIdentifier] relativeToURL:directory] absoluteURL];
    success = [[NSFileManager defaultManager] createDirectoryAtURL:directory withIntermediateDirectories:YES attributes:nil error:error];
    if (!success) {
        return NO;
    }
#endif


    NSURL* url = [directory URLByAppendingPathComponent:[NSString stringWithFormat:@"%@.binary.metallib", name]];  
    success = [archive serializeToURL:url error:error];
    return success;    
}
Note
In macOS, store resources outside your application bundle and within an appropriate directory. Storing runtime-created resources inside an application bundle can cause code-signing and verification errors when rebuilding. For more information on how to discover and diagnose these issues, see Testing a release build.
Run your app on a device to create a Metal binary archive at the URL in your code.
Extract the Binary Archive from Your App
After running your app, the resulting binary archive contains a single binary slice for the GPU architecture of your target device. In macOS, you can access the archive directly on your development computer at the path ${HOME}/Library/Application Support/${BUNDLE_ID}/${LIBRARY_NAME}.binary.metallib.
For archived binaries you produce on another type of device, retrieve them as follows:
Connect your device with the app that contains the archived binary to your development computer.
In Xcode, choose Window > Devices and Simulators.
Click the Devices tab and select the device and app you want to extract the binary from.
Click the More (...) icon, select Download Container, and save the container to a location on your development computer.
In Finder, navigate to the container’s saved location, Control-click it, and select Show Package Contents to open it.
Copy the binary archive located at AppData/Library/Application Support/${LIBRARY_NAME}.binary.metallib to another directory.

Use metal-lipo -archs to inspect a binary archive and display the compiled GPU architectures. For example, a MacBook M1 Pro produces an applegpu_g13g binary archive.
$ xcrun -sdk macosx metal-lipo device.binary.metallib -archs
applegpu_g13g air64_v26
Note that binary archives still contain a Metal IR slice, air64_v26. Metal may invalidate binaries when upgrading a device’s operating system, and shaders recompile from the Metal IR in the archive.
Copy and Modify the Configuration Script
The pipeline state that Metal builds during binary serialization is a pipeline configuration script, a JSON file with the extension mtlp-json. This is the data you retrieve from the binary archive and modify to compile new binary slices. Start by extracting the Metal binaries and configuration script from the archive using the metal-source command-line tool in Terminal.
% xcrun metal-source -flatbuffers=json device-compiled.binary.metallib -o extracted-source
Within the extracted-source directory is the configuration script that Metal uses to drive compilation. This file has a generated name ending with the extension mtlp-json. Use the find command in Terminal to locate and copy the file to metal-build.mtlp-json in the current directory.
% cp $(find extracted-source -type f -name '*.mtlp-json') ./metal-build.mtlp-json
You also need the path to a library containing a Metal IR slice for your shaders. Use the Metal library from Xcode’s compilation of your app that contains these shaders.
In the copied configuration script, you tell the Metal translator where to locate the Metal library from Xcode, and script a section that determines which GPUs to compile for. Open the created metal-build.mtlp-json file in a text editor and modify the path value to reference the path of your locally compiled library from Xcode.
  "libraries": {
    "paths": [
      {
        "label": "1D54EB2B266CDA015BA52C746856B43364E8204D7FB39B18E0C95882F132E4C0",
        "path": "./xcode-compiled-library.metallib"
      }
    ]
  },
Note
Some shader types, such as tile shaders, require specific GPU or Metal support. For Metal translator to compile binaries of these shaders, add an enable key to the pipeline description and set its value to a pipeline script defining which conditions make a valid platform. For full documentation on the script format, run man metal-pipelines-script in Terminal.
Run the metal-tt command-line tool in Terminal to generate a new archived binary. The following command builds for devices running iOS 16 that support Metal 3:
% xcrun -sdk iphoneos metal-tt -target air64-apple-ios16.0 -gpu-family metal3 ./metal-build.mtlp-json -o precompiled.binary.metallib
Tip
The metal-config command-line tool can provide a full set of compiler flags for metal-tt. For more information, run man metal-config in Terminal.
Any compatible device can load the precompiled.binary.metallib and skip runtime compilation of shaders. Running the metal-lipo command-line tool shows the available architectures.
% xcrun metal-lipo ./precompiled.binary.metallib -archs
applegpu_g12p applegpu_g13p applegpu_g13g applegpu_g14p applegpu_g14g applegpu_g16p applegpu_g15p
Add Your Compiled Binary Archive to Your App
To use this newly created Metal binary archive, you need to add it to your Xcode project’s bundle resources. Add the precompiled.binary.metallib archive to your project’s Copy Bundle Resources build phase. For instructions, see Customizing the build phases of a target.
For Metal to take advantage of precompiled binaries, load them with newBinaryArchiveWithDescriptor:error: and provide an MTLBinaryArchiveDescriptor with a url pointing to the binary archive. Then add them to a pipeline descriptor instance’s binaryArchives property.
MTLBinaryArchiveDescriptor* archiveDescriptor = [[MTLBinaryArchiveDescriptor alloc] init];
archiveDescriptor.url = [[NSBundle main] URLForResource:@"precompiled.binary" withExtension:@"metallib" subdirectory:nil];
if (archiveDescriptor.url == nil) {
    // Handle failing to load the binary archive.
}


id<MTLBinaryArchive> archive = [device newBinaryArchiveWithDescriptor:archiveDescriptor error:error];
if (archive == nil) {
    // Handle failing to load the binary archive.
}


pipelineDescriptor.binaryArchives = [pipelineDescriptor.binaryArchives arrayByAddingObject:archive];
Tip
Failing to load a binary archive isn’t a fatal error in Metal, and it falls back on the compilation of Metal IR at runtime. To cause a failure from the Metal system when an expected binary archive doesn’t load, configure your pipeline with an MTLPipelineOption of MTLPipelineOptionFailOnBinaryArchiveMiss.
