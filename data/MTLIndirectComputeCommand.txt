Protocol
MTLIndirectComputeCommand
A compute command in an indirect command buffer.
@protocol MTLIndirectComputeCommand
Overview
Don’t implement this protocol; you get objects of this type by asking a MTLIndirectCommandBuffer for them.
Use this object to reset or encode a command. You must always reset a command before encoding a new command.
Topics
Setting a Command's Arguments
- setComputePipelineState:
Sets the command’s compute pipeline state object.
Required
- setImageblockWidth:height:
Sets the size, in pixels, of the imageblock.
Required
- setKernelBuffer:offset:atIndex:
Sets a buffer for the compute function.
Required
- setThreadgroupMemoryLength:atIndex:
Sets the size of a block of threadgroup memory.
Required
- setStageInRegion:
Sets the region of the stage-in attributes to apply to the compute kernel.
Required
Synchronizing Command Execution
- setBarrier
Adds a barrier to ensure that commands executed prior to this command are complete before this command executes.
Required
- clearBarrier
Removes any barrier set on the command.
Required
Encoding a Compute Command
- concurrentDispatchThreadgroups:threadsPerThreadgroup:
Encodes a compute command using a grid aligned to threadgroup boundaries.
Required
- concurrentDispatchThreads:threadsPerThreadgroup:
Encodes a compute command using an arbitrarily sized grid.
Required
Resetting a Command
- reset
Resets the command to its default state.
Required
Instance Methods
- setKernelBuffer:offset:attributeStride:atIndex:
