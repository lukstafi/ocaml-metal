Protocol
MTLSharedEvent
An object you use to synchronize access to Metal resources across multiple CPUs, GPUs, and processes.
@protocol MTLSharedEvent
Overview
The MTLSharedEvent protocol inherits from and adds additional behaviors to MTLEvent. Use shared events only when you need to synchronize changes to resources across multiple Metal device objects, across processes, or between a device object and CPU access to resources. Otherwise, use nonshared events.
Don’t implement this protocol yourself; instead, to create a MTLSharedEvent object, call the newSharedEvent method of a MTLDevice object.
To pass this event to another process, first create a handle to the shared event by calling its newSharedEventHandle method. Then, transfer the handle to another process with XPC, and from that process, call the newSharedEventWithHandle: of a MTLDevice object.
For more information, see Synchronizing Events Across Multiple Devices or Processes and Synchronizing Events Between a GPU and the CPU.
